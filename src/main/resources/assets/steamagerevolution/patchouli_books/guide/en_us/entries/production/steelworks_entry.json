Constructing a machine from heat-resistant materials found in the Nether allows you to safely attain the high temperatures required for the production of steel. Given a working pool of molten iron equivalent to nine blocks (11664mB) and provided with carbon and injected steam, molten steel will be output at a rate of one nugget per operation."
