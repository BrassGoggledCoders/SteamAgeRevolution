Particularly useful for $(thing)pulverising ores$() into dusts that can then be combined to allow $(thing)creation of alloys$(). Soon, you will be able to build a machine that automates this repetitive rock breaking. The hammer is also useful in $(thing)shaping metals$() for use in machines - hammering ingots will create plates."
